# SWHAP@Pisa

The SWHAP@Pisa project is a joint venture of the [Department of Computer Science](https://di.unipi.it) of the [University of Pisa](https://unipi.it) and [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org)(SWH). It aims at defining and supporting a process to acquire sorce code to be saved in the SWH [archive](https://archive.softwareheritage.org/browse/search/?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FUnipisa%2F).

This repository brings together the documentation, the catalogue and other information about this process, dubbed SWH Acquisition Process (SWHAP) and its Github based support SWHAPPE (SWHAP Pisa Enactor).
