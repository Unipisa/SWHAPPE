1 - Software is everywhere,  binding our personal and social lives, embodying a vast part of the technological knowledge that powers our industry, and fuels innovation. Software is an essential mediator to access digital information and a pillar of modern research in all fields.

2 -In short, a rapidly increasing part of our collective knowledge is embodied in, or dependent on software artifacts. But software does not come out of the blue: it is written by humans, in the form of software source code, which is a precious, unique form of knowledge that can be readily translated into a form executable by a machine: already in the 1980’s Harold Abelson wrote “Programs must be written for humans to read”,1 and more recently Len Shustek stressed that “Source code provides a view into the mind of the designer”.3 It is essential to preserve this precious technical, scientific and cultural heritage over the long term.

3 - Software Heritage is a non profit, multi-stakeholder initiative, launched by Inria in partnership with Unesco, that has taken over this challenge. Its stated mission is to collect, preserve, and make readily accessible all the software source code ever written. As detailed in the CACM 2018 viewpoint article, Software Heritage has designed specific strategies to collect software according to its nature. For software that is easily accessible online, and that can be copied without specific legal authorisations, the approach is based on automation. This way, as of April 2019, Software Heritage has already archived more than 5 billion unique source code files collected from over 89 million different origins, focusing in priority on popular software development platforms like GitHub and GitLab and rescuing software source code from Google Code and Gitorious that were shutdown during the last years with more than 1.5 million projects hosted on them.

4 - For source code that is not easily accessible online and/or that requires curation, we need a different approach, based on a focused search, and with significant human intervention. The \DIPISASWHInitiative{} is the first major step in this direction: its goal is to design and evaluate a process to rescue, curate and illustrate landmark legacy source code. This process needs to take into account the variety of physical media where the source code may be stored, the multiple copies and versions that may be available, the potential input of the authors that are still alive, and the existence of ancillary material like documentation, articles, books, technical reports, email exchanges.

5 - Our purpose here is to present the current directions of the process which is currently under pilot implementation and experimental usage in the \DIPISASWHInitiative{} in order to get feedback from the HaPoC community. Here are the identified high-level requirements, for both preservation and illustration. They should accommodate all the furnishers, either the scavengers searching for relevant SC or the authors conferring their own work to SWH. They also need to take care of both offline and online SC.
Requirement 1 - non-functional. The activities related to offline (legacy) SC should converge as early as possible to those related to online SC.
Requirement 2 - preservation. The furnishers should have a standard way to save the original products, for later study by future stakeholders. This entails to characterize the  place where to store safely
1.1 the furnished SC supports, in case of offline SC (Warehouse, for later reference).
2.1 the digital version of the furnished SC, in case of online SC (Depository, for later reference)
Requirement 3 - preservation.  The furnishers should have standard support to SC curation (that is, to prepare what goes into the Vault)

6 - [Illustration requirement: provide the authors/scavengers with a standard way to save related documents (pictures, etc.) of historical relevance (that is, feed Wikidata)]

7 - [Highlights on the current design: open source, GitHub, Wikidata, Science Stories]

8 - [Experimental use: Run the process on a representative sample of SC developed in Pisa, in view of the 50th anniversary celebration, current candidates]

9 - [Conclusions: Confident that we can demonstrate the feasibility of a process which can be exported worldwide, with UNESCO support; also, it will support the objectives of Open Science. On a more philosophical side: is the goal sound or…?]
